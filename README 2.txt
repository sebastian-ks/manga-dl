_____________________________________

ABOUT THIS INSTRUCTION:

- Everything writte in " " is user input and can differ from your execution process depending on how u want to download

- Everything written in ' ' is a specific term that is to be used exactly the same as it is written in this instruction

- Note that as of now the app only supports 'MANGAZUKI.ME' and 'BATO.TO' 
  When trying to download from any but these sites it will not work!

- WINDOWS ONLY!!!



HOW TO EXECUTE:

1. The fast way (for pros)
---------------------------------
- Go to the directory that contains the files you downloaded from github

- Click on the address bar left of the search bar and type 'cmd' and press enter

- In the Command Prompt type 'manga-dl ' followed by the url of the Manga u want to download

- If u want to give a custom name to the epub then type '-t ' or '--title ' followed by the title u want after the url

- So the general command structure is:
	
	'manga-dl "url" -t "title"'

- Adding a title to your epub is completely optional. You can simply type: 'manga-dl "url"'
  The title of the epub will then be auto-generated based on data displayed on the actual website

- If u get a prompt from your firewall denying access click on 'grant access' to continue (This app is not a virus)

- When your download is finished you will find your epub in a folder called 'downloads'
  inside the folder you downloaded from github



2. The slow way (for noobs) 
----------------------------------
- Double click 'manga-dl.exe' inside the folder u downloaded from github

- A Command Prompt will appear asking u for the url of the Manga u want to download as well as for the title of the epub

- If u do not want to set a custom title simply type 'na' when asked for a title in the Command Prompt

- If u get a prompt from your firewall denying access click on 'grant access' to continue (This app is not a virus)

- When your download is finished you will find your epub in a folder called 'downloads'
  inside the folder you downloaded from github
